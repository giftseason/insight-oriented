            <br>
        </div>
        <p><strong>This post is about how I adopted 4 wild birds at the Wildlife Rescue Center in Stara Zagora (Bulgaria), and the first impressions of our meeting. The Wildlife Rescue Center, Stara Zagora is part of my project <a href="https://bgfundforwomen.org/bg/2021/07/23/11-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b8-%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8-%d1%89%d0%b5-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%87%d0%b0%d1%82-%d1%84/?fbclid=IwAR3vRHu0E78xHaBVM9IX9RPo-CDdY0EP1eXv6Fv40KyzsEyz5mGUvpixzec" target="_blank">'Mapping Sustainable Holidays in Bulgaria: Combine Volunteering and Holidays!'</a> funded by the Bulgarian Fund for Women.</strong></p>

            <h2>Why adopt birds?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With this blog post, I continue an environmental series about eco-friendly educational Bulgarian projects in the framework of my project based on a two-year long ethnographic study.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Adopting birds is one of the most exciting activities at the Wildlife Rescue Centre - Green Balkans in Stara Zagora. It is a symbolic practice when animal and bird lovers donate some money for their favourite species.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center5.jpg" alt="an owl" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>This owl is one of the four wild birds I adopted &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>One's birthday is the most frequent occassion when most people express this type of wildlife support. I wasn't an exception to this rule, and decided to spend my recent birthday with the adopted four birds.</p>
            <br>
            <p> A white stork, a grey heron and two owls are now under my wardship for several months.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The chosen birds are some of my favourite species, and I picked them from the list of the adoption programme.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With permanent disability, the birds are lifelong patients of the Wildlife Rescue Centre - Green Balkans in Stara Zagora (Bulgaria).</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center2.jpg" alt="birds" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Wild birds at the Wildlife Rescue Centre that can be adopted &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Indeed I see this form of engagement with wild birds is an excellent opportunity to learn about rare species and interact with them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The adoption scheme is a fundraising effort to treat ill animals and carry out conservation work to preserve extinct species.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Such symbolic adoption helps to provide birds with the necessary support needed in the result of habitat loss.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And it's a mutually beneficial form of engagement with wildlife too.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Birds get support, and their supporters find endless enjoyment and inspiration.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hundreds of people from different countries have supported the centre by adopting birds and donating money for their needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Curiously, the first adopters were inhabitants of the local orphan's home in the Stara Zagora region.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>A home for 500 injured birds</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center3.jpg" alt="cages with birds" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>The visiting area of the Wildlife Rescue Centre in Stara Zagora welcomew visitor every day &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>With three sections – a visiting area, rehabilitation and breeding – the  Wildlife Rescue Centre is home to over 500 wild birds, represented by 35 species.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of them are temporary there and after treatment will be released.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Others will stay there forever due to severe injuries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Electrical shock from power lines, collisions with vehicles, habitat loss, poaching are the main reasons for bird injuries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>'We'll send some birds to zoos across Europe, - says Hristina Klisurova, PR manager and vet. - Many of our pelicans, swans, storks and falcons have already found their new homes in Bulgarian, British and Czech zoos'.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Among my adopted birds</h2>
            <br>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>To meet the adopted birds, I came to the Wildlife Rescue Centre - Green Balkans in Stara Zagora.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For three days, I observed the busy activities of all three sections.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The breeding section and visitor centre are in the same area, and the rehabilitation department is about 200 metres further.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With people in medical uniform and injured birds in cages and enclosures, the place reminds a hybrid of lab and zoo.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center7.jpg" alt="medics treat an injured bird" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>The vets of the Wildlife Rescue Centre treat an injured buzzard &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>The two of my adopted birds, owls, live in cages, and two others, a stork and heron, walk around a fenced area.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While the owls are very calm, the stork has quite a quarrelsome personality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He's often engaged in arguments with other storks or herons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The heron, in contrast, is very shy and doesn't like to be in the public eye.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With over 120 video cameras in the cages and the area, the birds' activities are under constant scrutiny.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The bird caretaker  Dimitar Todorov (in the image below) starts his working day with careful analysis of the video data.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center-dimitar- todorov.jpg" alt="a young man looking at the screen" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Daily monitoring: Dimitar Todorov, a bird caretaker at the Wildlife Rescue Centre  &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>This's followed by food preparation for all the species and construction projects devoted to building nests.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All the permanent inhabitants of the centre have names.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of constant interaction with people, their behavioural patterns have changed significantly and developed a great curiosity about people's activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A striking example of such changes is the 15-year pink pelican Gruyo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He is the most amusing and interactive creature in the centre. He comes up to every visitor and greets them raising his only wiing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>15 years ago, after his encounters with poachers, he lost a part of the wing. The injury resulted in amputation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By the end of his life, he will require medical observation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Expressing his emotions with funny sounds and movements, Gruyo busily approaches every person that enters his area.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The daily interaction with volunteer Stilian Atanasov is one of the favourite activities of the bird.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The pelican enjoys eating from the boy's hands and playing with him.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-wildlife-rescue-center1.jpg" alt="a boy feeding a pelican" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Volunteer Stilian Atanasov feeds pink pelican Gruyo &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Stilian has been volunteering with the centre for over three years.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The 17-year schoolboy is finishing school and thinking of devoting his future career to animals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With his volunteering, he wants to support birds and, at the same time, to appeal to people to be thoughtful of the species they live by.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To learn more about different activities involving wild birds in Bulgaria, download below my award-winning guide The Insights into Conservation Volunteer Bird Watching Holidays in Bulgaria. It's Not Only About Birds.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I intend this manual on sustainable pastimes with birds for ordinary nature-lovers who enjoy new meaningful activities and environmental professionals that deal with volunteers. With this book I share just some of the valuable insights I gained. I also want to offer some food for though about original sustainable pastimes useful for discovering new dimensions of life.</p>
