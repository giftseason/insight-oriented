        <p><strong>The Association of Young Improvers for Youth Development (YIYD) by Valentin Kehayov has turned Smolyan, the smallest Bulgarian regional centre, into a generator of the biggest social changes. What is behind these processes? Read on and learn how to benefit from Erasmus+ trips!</strong></p>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>The team of volunteers of the YIYD, with their leader and the founder of the association Valentin Kehayov, has just returned from a youth exchange in Metoni (Greece).</p>
            <br>
            <p>MIMR is a partner of the Erasmus+ exchanging programme. More details <strong><a href="https://youngimprovers.eu" target="_blank">about the cross-cultural collaborations of YIYD are on their website</a></strong> and in <strong><a href="18+inspiring-ideas-about-eco-initiatives-in-bulgaria.html" target="_blank">my previous post</a></strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The participating countries in Metoni's project were Greece, Northern Macedonia, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through team sports and games, participants explored the possibilities of integration. Many youngsters have experienced barriers to integration due to physical disabilities or cultural/religious differences.</p>
            <br>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>They have been cultural ambassadors of cultural diversity in Europe through their activities in the field of sport.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Bulgarian volunteers from the towns of Smolyan and Madan and the villages of Tarun, Chepintsi, Rovino and Selishte worked on such issues as discrimination, xenophobia and racism.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sports values ​​are fundamental tools in similar projects based on volunteering. </p>
            <br>
            <p>They act as natural and helpful facilitators to show the youth how to prevent intolerance, social exclusion and marginalization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>'I am pleased to have had the opportunity to be the leader of the Bulgarian group because I myself grew up along with the young people, - said Valentin Kehayov, YIYD chairman. - I am impressed by their ambition and creativity. Due to its practical nature, the project was very useful for our volunteers. It helped them to acquire practical skills and knowledge '.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Everyone should allow the other to influence oneself</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/severim-bobachev-volunteers-from-smolyan-create- their-recipe-for-integration-erasmus+.jpg" alt="youngsters playing on the beach">
                <figcaption class="caption">Smolyan volunteer Severim Bobachev &copy; Valentin Kehayov</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Volunteer <strong>Severim Bobachev</strong>, the village of Selishte:</p>
            <br>
            <p>'This is my first international exchange project, and I didn't know what to expect, except that I would meet new people, but it turned out to be a lot of fun and educational.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had an incredible opportunity to get to know new cultures, opinions, people, and I understood a lot about myself. In my opinion, everyone should undergo such an experience at least once and allow the other to influence him.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The atmosphere itself was friendly on the part of the hosts. And the program perfectly balanced the time for activities with rest and entertainment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favourite part was the visit to the island of Sapienza, where we enjoyed beautiful views and unforgettable moments all day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The island located above the main sea route between Italy and the Middle East has seen many shipwrecks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There is also the habitat of the well-known kri-kri goats.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another favourite moment for me was the cultural evenings, where everyone had the opportunity to try typical food or learn traditional dance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the beginning, everyone had some worries and fears.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But by the last day, we all became a cohesive team where everyone understood each other only by sight.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I'll do my best to keep in touch with those incredible people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I recommend everyone who wants to experience something like this not to hesitate because such projects bring good emotions, acquaintances and friendships'.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Play more to improve your communication skills</h2>
            <br>

                <figcaption class="caption">Smolyan volunteer Rahim Hadjieminov &copy; Valentin Kehayov</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Volunteer <strong>Rahim Hadjieminov</strong>, Smolyan:</p>
            <br>
            <p>'For me, speaking in public and any public appearances are not my strong point, but projects like this give me the enthusiasm and confidence to overcome these challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my opinion, one of the most positive aspects of the exchange is that I have significantly improved my communication skills and learned to communicate easily with other participants.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was due to our constant teamwork and also the trust games. I expanded my worldview and had fun with incredible people with whom I made friends.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I loved that the program included many activities on the beach.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The project program allowed us to get to know both the participants and the city. We had a city quiz, which helped us to see the sights of the beautiful coastal location in a more fun way.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Let's create new recipes for success together!</h2>

                <figcaption class="caption">Chairman of Young Improvers for Youth Development Valentin Kehayov, Smolyan &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Chairman of Young Improvers for Youth Development <strong>Valentin Kehayov</strong>:</p>
            <br>
            <p>'Our association was created by young people and for young people. It allows effectively working in a team and boost personal development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To raise new leaders, we apply non-formal education and volunteering in Smolyan and the region.</p>
            <br>
            <p>YIYD organizes workshops and training in Smolyan and other places in the region, and young people also participate in international exchange.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our great pride is the youth space with a capacity of about 120 young people, where young people gather together to share ideas and experiences, study and talk, play board games and have fun.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are trying to improve their skills and to help them to acquire new competencies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Volunteering is a big cause for me. It has already proven useful for the whole mountain region, not just for these 100 people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And, importantly, all institutions have joined our projects. We regularly develop new collaborations.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>So far, no party or organization in Smolyan has closed the door before us. We simply come and say:</p>
            <br>
            <p>'Your kids are in our organization, you live in this city, let's do something together'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even the most inefficient institutions began acting because they saw the effect and the fact that things could happen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We really gave them a spark that any changes are not that complicated how it may look, and it's possible to change something when you're not burdened by political bias.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our mission is to unite young people from different cultures and nationalities and provide them with a productive and creative environment for development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It, in turn, will allow them to develop necessary competencies for success and achieve a higher level of self-knowledge and build critical thinking and strategy for success.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are young people, loving, dreaming and creating! We change ourselves, our loved ones and our city.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We dream and find a way to make our dreams come true. So, if you are also a dreaming and creative person, join us!</p>
