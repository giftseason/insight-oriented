            <h2>Dolling Street Vibes</h2>
            <br>
            <p>World Puppetry Day on March 21 is a great occasion to explore one of the most salient parts of Bulgarian culture â€“ puppet-making.</p>
           <br>
           <figure>
              <img src="images/fireter-street-show.jpg" alt="crowds at a street show">

            </figure>
           <br>
            <p>Pagan dolls and their links to nature feature many Bulgarian traditions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The pandemic travel restrictions and the quest for safe pastimes have triggered a new surge of interest in puppet performances.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Gradually, marionettes have become beloved entertainers in street shows across Bulgaria.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Experimenting with puppetry and other art forms, many modern artists create new original performances that wow audiences in Bulgaria and abroad.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/The woollen theatre from a coat children.jpg" alt="crowds at a street show">
              <figcaption class="caption">Yaroslava Bykova's woolen theatre in Plovdiv &copy; Yaroslava Bykova</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>The puppet projects of Plamen Ivanov, Fireter, and Yaroslava Bykova are the best illustrations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The former also skilfully rethinks pagan traditions in many shows and reflects Bulgarian nature in his puppets (the snail-mobile and puppets of mantises).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Yaroslava's marionettes are popular with theatre lovers in England, France, Ireland, Russia, and the USA.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Fireter's performances cheered up spectators in England, Greece, Germany and Russia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the following interviews, each artist shares the secrets of the incredible marionettes and fairy tales they tell.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Plamen Ivanov on activating gigantic puppets by Fireter</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/fireter (11).jpg" alt="crowds at a street show">
              <figcaption class="caption">Crowds around giant marionettes in a turn for photosessins &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Plamen, the Fireter collection has some of the hugest dolls in Europe - over 6 meters. What kinds of creatures do you have?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>We can roughly divide them into four groups: animals, human dolls, fairy creatures, and vehicles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our biggest ones are the 7-meter-long spider and the 6-meter-long giant mantises.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/spider-by-fireter.jpg" alt="crowds at a street show">
                <figcaption class="caption">Plamen Ivanov runs a spider during a rehearsal &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Only the big blue giants of similar size can compete with them in scale.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Last September, they debuted at a mountainous festival in our favourite Plovdiv.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The blue giants, our newest puppets created seven months ago, belong to the 'human dolls' category.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/blue-gigantic-puppets-fireter.jpg" alt="crowds at a street show">
                <figcaption class="caption">The blue and white 5-meter-tall marionettes are the newest Fireter characters &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Firemobiles are another category of our doll-props. The most outstanding is the snail-mobile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's a giant vehicle in the shape of a snail made of wood and metal with many hiding places and small surprises for children, moving on its own and driven by a crazy professor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The group can also include our Christmas glowing and singing pumpkin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another group represents a group of fairy creatures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We can add a green forest dwarf and his sister Clotilde (12 years old), one of our first puppets of the size of large children that we operate from stilts.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>

                <figcaption class="caption">A dwarf preparing for another street show &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Royal De Luxe performers, known for their giant puppets, operate them with cranes and dozens of performers. How do you manage your giant puppets?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>We don't have as many resources for expensive equipment as our French colleagues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to our creative team, we found more affordable means to create fantastic shows our spectators love.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In our giants, we combine creativity, feasibility, and safety matters.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/fireter-street-performance.jpg" alt="colourful performers on stilts">
                <figcaption class="caption">Colourful Fireter performances feature Bulgarian street shows &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Innovative materials ensure the impressive designs of our puppets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The mastery of our performers on stilts animates all those fantastic creatures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are always happy to watch how our audience interacts with our puppets. And it's safe because our performers are very mobile, and the puppets' constructions are flexible and light.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>How many actors manipulate your puppets?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/fireter (8).jpg" alt="performers making up before another show">
                <figcaption class="caption">Behind the stage &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>You will be surprised, but only three artists on stilts operate each of the 6-meter blue giants. And only one person runs each of our green mantises, a puppet on four stilts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Very few Fireter performers dare to maneuver green creatures because it is rather challenging, as they are our heaviest and most dangerous costumes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are fans inside, and we also leave some water for the contractor to avoid dehydration.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>What stories do your marionettes tell spectators during street performances?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Our genre is the fairy tale, and to create another story, we collaborate with the best authors and musicians.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/fireter (2).jpg" alt="a fire street show">
                <figcaption class="caption">Firing a street show &copy; Fireter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>For our giant mantises, we told a story about dangerous creatures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A black witch controls them and walks them through the central parts of the city. She does her best to prevent them from causing damage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With big, cheerful blue giants, it all begins with dances in the woods.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our fire performances add more dramatic details to the show.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We experiment with different art genres and always offer our audience something new.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another artifact - the snail-mobile - is not just a strange large vehicle but a labyrinth of entrances through which the little kids can enter a stick where surprises await them or open a fairy window and find an old suitcase.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>

            <h2>Yaroslava Bykova on felting a mini-puppet theatre</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/woolen-mini-theater-by-yaroslava-bykova.jpg" alt="9 tiny colourful puppets">

            <br>
            <p><strong>Slava, your woollen puppets have become a colourful feature of modern Bulgarian street art. Performances in Varna, Plovdivâ€¦ Where did the idea come from?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>I make toys all my life. Yet, I began working with wool 12 years ago when I saw a puppet theatre from Plovdiv for the first time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They came for a festival in Omsk, my home town (Russia).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was deeply impressed by the Bulgarian marionettes. I started ordering Bulgarian wool and making different toys, pictures, clothes, and marionettes.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Yaroslava-and-Varvara-EU-Plovdiv-School-of-Participation-2019.jpg" alt="9 tiny colourful puppets">
                <figcaption class="caption">Yaroslava Bykova presents her unique mini-theatre at Plovdiv 2019 &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>The best wool I've ever seens, really!</p>
            <br>
            <p>And while choosing where to live in Bulgaria, my family considered only two options: Plovdiv, the creative region, and Kardzhali, the wool production centre.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But when we saw Plovdiv, we fell in love with the city and stayed there.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Which techniques do you use for making puppets?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Felting. Only. It's a process of producing a creative artifact by combining and compressing loose fibers or wool.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love this means of expression because it allows great creativity, and all artworks have their individuality and look incredibly sophisticated.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I create miniature marionettes for amateur theatre lovers, but I also make puppets for creative professionals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Several years ago, famous Russian writer Faina Grinberg ordered a puppet of FranÃ§ois Villon that she needed to understand better the storyline of her next play.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Yaroslava-bykova-with-a-puppet-of-Francois-Villon.jpg" alt="9 tiny colourful puppets">
                <figcaption class="caption">Yaroslava Bykova with a puppet of Francois-Villon &copy; Yaroslava Bykova</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p><strong>How much time does it take to make such tiny puppets?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>It takes me three days minimum of intensive work to create the smallest personage of a woollen theatre, a figure 8-centimeters long. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For one puppet, I use between 20 and 30 grams of wool.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>And how do you choose protagonists for woollen theatres?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>All the little performers are from our, my children's and mine, favourite cartoons and fairy-tales such as Mumintrolls and My Neighbor Totoro.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>You frequently experiment with your puppets at different events and street shows. I still remember your incredible theatre in the coat. And how do those who buy your theatre use it?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/The-woollen-theatre-from-a-coat.jpg" alt="children watch a theatre performance from a coat">
                <figcaption class="caption">Theatre in the coat by Yaroslava Bykova in Plovdiv &copy; Yaroslava Bykova</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>My first theatre went to an American acting school to teach students performing arts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Their teacher personally selected the set of puppets in Rukadelnitsa.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many art lovers from England, France, Ireland, Russia, and Bulgaria order woollen theatres as gifts for children or home concerts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm happy that my toys entertained people during these difficult times and still provide many with ideas for pleasant pastimes even after prolonged COVID restrictions.</p>
