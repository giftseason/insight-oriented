            <br>
            <p>The training for sustainable practices "Equality and Climate Justice" was a three-day event organized by the Bulgarian Fund for Women in lovely spa-town Bankya in June.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bankya itself is a synonym for sustainability. The small Bulgarian town is a well-known international spa resort and one of the best Bulgarian destinations for sustainable travel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We enjoyed the warm hospitality of Bankya Palace Hotel, which takes care of one of the main local landmarks - a 20-year-old ficus grown from the ground in the building.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Our trainers were Madeleine Popignatova, participant of the Dutch feminist climate movement, Kirilka Angelova, expert in non-formal education, Milia Dimitrova, lawyer and mediator in Sofiaplan and Georgi Stefanov, expert on climate change programs of WWF - Bulgaria.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Together, we explored the role of women and vulnerable groups in the processes of climate change, examined the Bulgarian reality, and possible opportunities and tried to understand how to integrate our ego into socially useful initiatives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because often what is good for some people is bad for others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was the main idea through which we explored such concepts as the social construction of gender and climate justice.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking advantage of the high concentration of activism in one place, I asked environmental activists through my blog to share their tips on how to bring about positive changes in communities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the initiator of this dialogue, I will begin with my proposal.</p>

            <br>
            <p>My community is virtual and includes dozens of professionals involved in cultural and environmental projects across Europe.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The articles of my blog - <strong><a href="interviews.html" target="_blank">interviews</a></strong> and <strong><a href="trips.html" target="_blank">travel tips</a></strong> - are inspired by encounters with all those people and their social initiatives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Two years ago, I created my blog to share positive experiences from different countries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The main feature of these ideas is that they are transferable and can work out well in many places.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I encourage people to collaborate more and engage in meaningful partnerships through promoting their experiences with meaningful content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Share Ideas & Inspire Change is the motto of my blog, my life credo and my main advice to those looking for fruitful cooperation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through my award-winning blog and <strong><a href="holidaysinbulgaria.html" target="_blank">recently written guide to sustainable vacations in Bulgaria</a></strong> I offer ideas on how to combine one's pastime and hobbies with useful for community activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The offered tips are inspired by my participation in such projects as <strong><a href="pomorielaketherapy.html" target="_blank">the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade</a></strong>.</p>

            <br>
            <p>With an impressive area of 22,000 ha and over 300 plant species, <strong><a href="http://www.ppbulgarka.net/" target="_blank">Nature Park Bulgarka</a></strong> is in the centre of Bulgaria.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We try to involve people in the restoration of biological diversity, the promotion of cultural heritage and the development of nature tourism.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Baits and games are the main tools for involving different stakeholders.</p>
            <br>
            <p> For instance, for one of our community clean-ups, we invited the famous Bulgarian actor Philip Avramov, who was the face of the promotional campaign. Many people joined the initiative only to see him.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once people understood the importance of clean-ups, they joined similar projects without any "hooks".</p>
            <br>
            <p>To achieve the best results in projects with children, we provoke them with various games (e.g. Forest Ranger) to think about the consequences of their actions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Children themselves need to feel that they can be part of the problem of environmental pollution. They need to understand how to correct their habits and be an example of responsible citizens.</p>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>In Smolyan, we develop volunteering as a valuable tool of non-formal education. Our main goal is to build community leaders.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are also an active participant in Erasmus+ programmes related to informal education and constantly engaged in international cultural exchange. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We have a youth centre where we help youngsters to improve their skills and acquire new competencies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our latest project is two graffiti paintings, which have quickly become the new tourist attractions in Smolyan and have united many people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now the space is wildly popular and is used for selfies, weddings, exhibitions, classes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Previously, street art had never been popular in Smolyan. Illegal paintings and vandalism were real pains.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We invited those local vandals to try volunteering and organized for them practical graffiti workshops by famous Bulgarian artists.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now they guard the public art in the town and prevent any vandalism.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But it was essential for young people to change their attitudes. We have noticed that when their attitude changes, so do their lifestyle.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the participation in various volunteer projects, youngsters actually not just give away their time, but they themselves also benefit a lot.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They develop practical skills, which in a sterile school environment are impossible to acquire.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This, in turn, allows young people to become more competitive in the labour market. </p>
            <br>
            <p>They find better jobs and do it faster because they know how to present their skills.</p>

            <p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at the Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Fisheries (IGB) in Berlin. My topic is "Impact of hydropower on rivers."</p>
            <br>
            <p>My social activity reflects my interest in fishing and has to do with the Balkanka Fishing Club in the village of Nikyup.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We organize green schools, clean-ups, fight illegal landfills, send signals to institutions and try to improve water and natural resource management in general.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Those who want to see positive change in their communities need to start by involving their loved ones, friends and acquaintances in their projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Surely, there will be those who won't understand why to change something and even those who will interfere. It is normal and should not be discouraged.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To change Bulgaria, it is important to support the social initiatives of others too. Let's start now!</p>

            <p>Many children are ashamed of their background. And I was in that situation due to my mixed Bulgaria-Roma origin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With my teaching activity, I aim to boost the children's self-confidence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another project I am involved in is a women's group that supports vulnerable families. As a keen poet, at our gatherings, I particularly love to share my poetry pieces. Using figurative language it is easier to discuss uncomfortable issues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We also work with negative stereotypes against Roma women with different educational community events in collaboration with local social services.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In fact, Roma women are wonderful mothers and their experiences can be appied in different communities! At the annual competition for the best mothers in Sliven, a Roma woman who raised ten children besides her own became the winner.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In Sliven, we organize many events where families from Bulgarian and Roma communities meet and share their experiences on how to take care of children.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We need to open our hearts and souls and spread goodness.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If we pass on the good, like a boomerang, the time will come, and people will become better.</p>

            <p>Last August, I organized the environmental initiative For AseNOVgrad. Its goal was to wake up the people of my home town and together tackle environmental issues through cleaning the public places and organising community art gatherings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It all started with a clean-up of the two largest local parks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Passers-by, seeing our small group cleaning the area, started joining us. Gradually, more than 30 strangers worked together like good friends.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That day among the volunteers were employees of the Municipality of Asenovgrad and the owners of the restaurant "Summer Cinema".</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since then, together with my team, we have implemented with the help of my supporters more than ten environmental projects: clean-ups, environmental art exhibitions and workshops.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For most of them, neither a lot of money nor a lot of resources are required.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I am a member of the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds and Green Balkans because I am an avid bird watcher.</p>

            <p>It will help to work out a practical new solution.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because often the 'traditional' solutions are related to similar but, at the same time, different problems. And they simply do not meet our current needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Moreover, they are the product of a ruling class that tends to replace our needs and feelings and puts them second to the basic ideology of the time.</p>

            <br>
            <p>For example, the introduction of instrumental and orchestral  music, which has never been popular in Haskovo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It took several years for people to start appreciating these genres. Now our orchestra attracts new musicians and gathers many spectators.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We particularly focus on new collaborations, and one of my latest initiatives is related to the development of new ideas and building partnerships.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experience shows that often the most splendid idea is not implemented, but it is part of the process. Dreams are an inexhaustible resource!</p>
