            <h2>Illustrations for fashion</h2>
            <p>For two years self-taught <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/czikkcakk/" target="_blank">designer and illustrator czikkcakk</a></strong> (Panni Czikkely) from Veszprem-Balaton has created the Instagram community pannifalva with 20 000 + followers and collaborated with many fashion brands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a special interview that continues the series of interviews with creative professionals from European Capitals of Culture on the Cultural Insights, 26-years-old Panni shares the pros and cons of being an Instagram celebrity and practical tips on managing a personal account.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- Panni, which topics do you prefer to work with?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>People, feelings, nature and the fusion of these… I live for creating art and giving people a piece of my creativity to enjoy.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p><strong>- What are your recent projects about during this special time when your <strong><a href="https://veszprembalaton2023.hu/en" target="_blank">home region is preparing for the status of the European Capital of Culture?</a></strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>For the fourth year in a row I've made calendars with my art.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I had very fruitful collaborations. I’d been dreaming of making a diary for a long time and with Fatimapanka my dream came true.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Illustrating a storybook was another my aspiration, and it was great to get a request from Diána Molnár to illustrate her book ‘DinnaDalok’.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The wrappings of the ‘Flancos’ clothing line were real works of love, I immediately recognised the message the brand wanted to create for their customers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also designed four new patterns for the baby clothing brand ‘4babies’.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Last March ‘Springfield’ selected me to represent Hungarian artists and express what femininity and authenticity meant to me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve worked with Dorina László on many video clips, I made animations. With Dorina, we also have a common brand Cakkompakkom and sew reusable shopping bags with my patterns.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Sources of inspiration</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/panni-czikkely-coffee.jpg" alt="a drawing and a cup of coffee">
                <figcaption>Coffee makes it all better.  &copy; Panni Czikkely</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- What fuels your creativity?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Coffee is my lifeblood, humour and my plants are my essences.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- 20000+ pannifalva followers. You’re engaged in quite an intensive cultural exchange. Must be challenging…</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Definitely! First, I used my Instagram as an album for my works, and I was amazed at how those beautiful pictures moved people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Then, two years ago I read some articles on influencer-marketing and started to run my account more consciously.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The pros were new valuable personal and professional experiences, I enjoyed being a supportive creator of community and feeling kindness and motivation from my followers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The cons had to do with the fact that you always had to be there, it’s so time-consuming. And there is also a need for dealing with the thieves that prey on those that have a lot of followers.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- What lesson did you learn?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>One must accept that appealing to everyone is impossible. And art cannot be copied. Thieves are always a few steps short of the real deal, so don’t get as distressed as I used to.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hobby and profit</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/panni-czikkely-2.jpg" alt="a set of drawings">
                <figcaption>It all started as a hobby.  &copy; Panni Czikkely</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- In your opinion, is it possible for amateur artists to turn their hobby into a source of income?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>I am mostly self-taught and only took two drawing classes at an art school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many inspiring and educational courses are available online. I have a Skillshare account and strive to learn something new every month.</p>
            <br>
            <p>People who would like to make some money out of all this have to be very conscious and determined because the market is very competitive.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>- You have recently had a workshop at Pannon UniFest. What it was about?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>It was an online event this time but my video is still available. I talked about my Instagram experience, my current collaborations and I also shared some tips on managing an Instagram profile better.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p><strong>- Your home region Veszprem-Balaton is preparing to hold the status of the future European Capital of Culture in 2023. As a local, can you share some insights on the best place to visit?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Lake Balaton is the best place for everything: photo sessions, bike trips and great picnics!</p>
            <br>
            <p>And it's a great source of inspiration too. Last year's bike trips around the lake resulted in a series of six works that represented different faces of the lake.</p>
