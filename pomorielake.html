        <p><strong>To make the 25th anniversary of the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade more memorable, I designed a magnet and organized a communication workshop to strengthen the volunteer network. Lake Pomorie is part of my project <a href="https://bgfundforwomen.org/bg/2021/07/23/11-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b8-%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8-%d1%89%d0%b5-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%87%d0%b0%d1%82-%d1%84/?fbclid=IwAR3vRHu0E78xHaBVM9IX9RPo-CDdY0EP1eXv6Fv40KyzsEyz5mGUvpixzec" target="_blank">'Mapping Sustainable Holidays in Bulgaria: Combine Volunteering and Holidays!'</a> funded by the Bulgarian Fund for Women.</strong></p>

            <p>With this blog post, I continue an environmental series about eco-friendly educational Bulgarian projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My book Cultural Insights into Conservation Volunteer Bird Watching Holidays in Bulgaria. It's Not Only About Birds! offers to choose the most comfortable format of sustainable activities in Bulgaria.</p>

            <p>Download it at the end of this article.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the short blog posts, I address the question of WHAT participants can learn from participation in the five major birdwatching Bulgarian activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And with my book, I provide more details on HOW and WHEN one can sign in for the vacation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, you can choose many thematical communities and participate in other activities.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Such eco-friendly vacations as the Pomorie Lake Volunteer Brigade by Green Balkans, <strong><a href="https://greenbalkans.org/Priklyuchi-Konservatsionna-brigada-Pomoriysko-ezero-2021--1-7422" target="_blank">the legendary initiative with a 25-year history</a></strong>, are the most comfortable way to learn about environmental issues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to volunteer  activities, lectures, parties.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This year, with the volunteers, we promoted - the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade on social media and reached over 500 people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Pomorie Lake Volunteer Brigade is a part of a conservation initiative by Green Balkans.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is devoted to the restoration of sandwich terns in Pomorie and the support of their habitat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pomorie Lake is on the European second largest bird migration route - Via Pontica.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since 1996, the Pomorie Lake Volunteer Brigade has been uniting nature lovers on a September vacation by Pomorie Lake.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This year, 30 volunteers from different countries participated in the Brigade. The youngest was seven years old, and the oldest was 57.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For one week, we worked to restore a washed-up artificial island where hundreds of sandwich terns rest and breed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The sandwich tern is a gull-like bird coloured grey above, white bellow with a distinctive black cap on the head.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/mapping-sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-pomorie-lake4.jpg" alt="A flock of sandwich terns" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>The colony of sandwich terns on Pomorie Lake  &copy; Green Balkans</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>The species breeds in dense colonies. They don't build traditional nests and usually lay their eggs on the sand or ground.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To protect themselves from predators, the birds choose more aggressive feathered neighbours.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With a long-lasting conservation programme and volunteer support, Green Balkans restored the sandwich tern colony in Pomorie from 6 pairs in 1996 to 1500 pairs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most impressive ecological successes in the modern history of Bulgaria!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Two newly created artificial islands on Pomorie Lake became the practical solution. However, waves regularly destroy them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Every September, volunteers come to Pomorie to improve the birds' habitat.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>I was lucky to twice participate in the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade in 2020 and 2021. Here are <strong><a href="pomorielaketherapy.html" target="_blank">the last year's insights into its activities</a></strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lake Pomorie is part of my project 'Mapping Sustainable Holidays in Bulgaria: Combine Volunteering and Holidays!' funded by the Bulgarian Fund for Women.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With my 2-year ethnographic study, I have researched over ten projects in such Bulgarian regions as Pomorie, Burgas, Stara Zagora, and Sofia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They deserve more public attention because they were inspired by a powerful but underestimated Bulgarian birdwatching social movement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It all began over 30 years ago with the establishment of the two oldest Birdwatching volunteer vacations by the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (more details are <strong><a href="atanasovskolakecamp.html" target="_blank">in this post</a></strong>) and Green Balkans.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Playing while working by Pomorie Lake</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/mapping-sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-pomorie-lake6.jpg" alt="A selfie of Anelia Pavlova" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>A selfie of Anelia Pavlova by Green Balkans during my presentation at the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade &copy; Anelia Pavlova</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>For this edition of the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade, I prepared two activities for the volunteers – two presentations and a game based on sharing of social media posts with the hashtags #рибарка2021 or #рибарки2021.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The hashtags featured the symbol for Pomorie Lake bird species – the sandwich tern.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my two presentations on communication and networking, we explored new meanings and opportunities the Brigade offered the volunteers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We did it through an interactive game that aimed to attract more people from different social groups.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We shared social media posts about our activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade is a very prestigious environmental project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, it offers its participants great professional benefits.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This point was one of the topics of my final presentation related to strengthening the volunteer network during the 25th Brigade.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I offered the volunteers to join a game and share different Facebook and Instagram posts about the Brigade using the hashtag #рибарка2021 or #рибарки2021.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By playing, we learned to communicate, involve more people, and reflect on our experiences on CVs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The idea was to promote the project by reaching more social groups and learn to support each other while working on a common cause.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Everyone has a different user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's essential to assist each other by sharing posts, adding comments, and more hashtags to link the message to the place, Pomorie, and the organization, Green Balkans.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, seven volunteers participated in the #рибарка2021 game.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/mapping-sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-pomorie-lake7.jpg" alt="A group of volunteers at night" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>The workshop of Bats ID by Anelia Pavlova was one of the activities we promoted with the volunteers &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>We reached over 500 people for one week in 5 countries (Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary, Turkey and Ukraine).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I chose the winners in 3 categories: the Most Creative Campaign – Maria Mitkova, the Most Supportive Campaign – Nikolay Kolev, and the Most Comprehensive Campaign – Stefan Ivanov.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each winner has their style of communication.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While Maria prepared a report of daily events, Nikolay and Stefan reflected on the highlights —for instance, the jubilee 150th stick of the new fence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Among other informative contributions were those by Anelia Pavlova, Polia Ruseva, and Mina Popova, and a philosophical remark by our French volunteer Lucien Depuydt: the Gods help those who help themselves.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe such diverse creative voices united in a joint effort are forceful to reach people from different social groups. To make it work, similar communication activities should be integrated into the programme of the Brigade on a regular basis.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reflecting the symbol of the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade on magnets</h2>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/mapping-sustainable-holidays-in-bulgaria-pomorie-lake5.png" alt="the design of the magnet" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>The design of the magnet and the photo of volunteer Stefan Ivanov that inspired the idea with the magnet &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>All the participants of the game got nice prizes – badges with birds and specially created anniversary magnets devoted to the symbol of the Brigade - a kite.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We got the informal symbol last year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The idea belongs to our veteran volunteer Stefan Ivanov, who joined the Pomorie Lake Volunteer Brigade in the first year of its existence in 1996.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While gathering litter during last year's Brigade, Stefan suddenly spotted a dirty but functional kite, launched it, and stated: 'Let it be the symbol of our Brigade!'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Later, he found another 'functional' piece of rubbish that he gave me. Learn more details about this curious story from <strong><a href="pomorielaketherapy.html" target="_blank">last year's post.</a></strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Interestingly, Stefan's idea inspired the logo of my blog – a person launching a kite.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/pomorie-lake-volunteer-brigade-symbol.jpg" alt="i am presenting the design of the magnet" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>I am presenting the design of the magnet to the volunteers of the Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade - 2021 &copy; Tatyana Garkavaya</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>It perfectly reflects the motto Share Ideas & Inspire Changes!</p>
            <br>
            <p>And this year, I decided to create beautiful magnets – a stylized post stamp documenting the launch of the kite.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The design is a creative collaboration of Jana Ivanova, a designer and maker of Kotlen carpets, and Yaroslava Bykova, an illustrator and puppet maker.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I used the idea of the post stamp to highlight Stefan's original contribution to the history of the Brigade.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Post stamps add value to any message. Only meaningful historical events decorate stamps.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Indeed, inspiring examples, like one by Stefan Ivanov, should be celebrated and remembered all the time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's how the positive experiences are enhanced, shared, and institutionalized.</p>
            <br>

                <figcaption>The great knot &copy; Nikolay Kolev</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Birdwatching is the main bonus for the participants of the Brigade.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And it's great to do it with knowledgeable birders like Nikolay Kolev, a known eco-activist whose systematic observations make part of studies of many Bulgarian ecological organizations (Green Balkans, the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB), etc.).</p>
            <br>
            <p>This year's Niki's outstanding discovery has become a true sensation and sparked numerous discussions in birdwatching groups on social media.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He photographed and shared some images of the great knot, which he first mistook for the great knot, a very similar species.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Previously, Bulgarian ornithologists never recorded the bird in the country.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It nests in Siberia and migrates to Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Arabian peninsula.</p>
            <br>

            <p>This year's Pomorie Lake Conservation Brigade-2021 was organised in the framework of the project LIFE19 NAT/BG/000804 protection of the Pomorie Lagoon funded by the EU.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For us, the regular participants of the Brigade, the positive energy from a one-week vacation fuels many activities during the year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's due to its existence at the intersection of different cultures and generations.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>It's the outcome my two-year-long ethnographic study across different Bulgarian regions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This book is a collaborative guide to conservation holidays in Bulgaria focused on volunteering, bird watching and protection of birds’ habitats.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The word ‘collaborative’ means that the book is based on 30 interviews with participants of conservation activities in different Bulgarian regions: Pomorie, Burgas, Stara Zagora, Durankulak, Sofia, Kotel, etc. The guide is the final stage of my two-year-long project ‘Mapping Sustainable Holidays in Bulgaria: Combine Volunteering and Holidays!’.</p>
